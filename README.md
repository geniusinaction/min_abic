# min_abic

Some scripts for inverting for geophysical parameters (fault slip) from geophysical data using ABIC. These were used in Funning (2005) and Funning et al. (2014) to solve the problem of jointly inverting InSAR and seismic waveform data for the slip evolution of the 1997 Manyi, Tibet earthquake.
